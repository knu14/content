                    <head>TINNED MEATS IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The question of the importation of Ameri-
                    can tinned meats into Egypt has aroused con-
                    siderable intertest in view of the recent terrible 
                    revelations as to its ingredients. A few days 
                    ago a correspondent wrote suggesting that 
                    the Alexandria Municipality should exercise 
                    some control, but we understand such duties 
                    do not come at present within the purview of 
                    the Municipality. Of course such functions 
                    are really municipal, but owing to commercial 
                    treaties considerable difficulties stand in the 
                    way. One step in advance in this direction 
                    has already been made, the Government having 
                    approved only this week of the temporary 
                    measures drawn up by the Municipality for 
                    the control of frozen meat imports. At to 
                    canned and tinned meats, the Municipality is 
                    absolutely powerless to exert any control, and 
                    it is much to be regretted that such is the 
                    case. It is to be hoped that the Egyptian 
                    Government will take up this question, for it is 
                    essential that there should be some method 
                    of preventing noisome foodstuffs being foisted 
                    on the community.</p>
                    <p>In another column we publish two letters from 
                    the Egyptian Agents for Mr. Armour's food-
                    stuffs, but we regret that their assertions 
                    cannot be considered to be of a character to 
                    satisfy the public, especially in view of the 
                    extraordinarily weak defence in Mr. Armour's 
                    recently issued book “The Packers and the 
                    People.” The London newspaper criticism
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    of thin book deserves to be read side by side 
                    with the letters of Mr. Armour's Egyptian 
                    Agents. The “Daily Mail” says :—</p>
                    <p>On the question of meat-packing Mr. Armour 
                    is cunningly silent. It is true that he has 
                    much to say of the malice of his “yellow” 
                    opponents, of the folly of axe-grinding, of the 
                    infamy of those “who do not care to come into 
                    the open,” but even in the few pages which he 
                    does devote “to cleanliness and sanitation,” 
                    he is content with the vaguest assertion. 
                    Though he allows that the “slaughtering of 
                    meat animals and converting them into food 
                    products is not a parlour business,” he is con-
                    fident of his own and his colleagues' rectitude.</p>
                    <p>"The sanitary conditions of the yards is 
                    now pronounced to lie practically perfect,” says 
                    he. And he pleads for a cessation of criticism 
                    on the ground of expediency.</p>
                    <p>“The period of unwarranted and unintel-
                    ligent criticism of the packers”---thus he ar-
                    gues “through which we are now passing 
                    directly affects this very large export element 
                    in our national prosperity. Every time an 
                    American sensation-monger, political agitator, 
                    or writer for the ‘yellow’ periodicals seeks to 
                    attract an audience by attacking the packers, 
                    he aims a blow at the entire live stock and 
                    meat-producing industry of the United States 
                    —at every cattleman, hog raiser, and sheep 
                    grower, and every person engaged in the meat-
                    producing and meat-distributing business.”</p>
                    <p>Was there ever a more absurd argument 
                    advanced than this? We care not a jot how 
                    many blows are aimed at the raisers of sheep 
                    and pigs. We are determined that pots of 
                    poisons shall not be imported into England in 
                    order to help the meat-producing industry of 
                    the United States. And the remedy of the 
                    packers is simple and obvious. They may, if 
                    they will, invite a stringent inspection. Had 
                    they strengthened the hands of the Govern-
                    ment a real measure of reform might already 
                    have been passed, and something like confidence 
                    restored to the buyers of Europe. But nothing 
                    has yet been done to satisfy the moderate and 
                    legitimate critics, and if the next balance-sheet 
                    of Packingtown shows a deplorable decrease 
                    in profits, the fault will be the packers’, and 
                    the packers’ only.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, nothing is stranger in this contro-
                    versy than the levity of those who would send 
                    their cans of mystery broadcast over the earth. 
                    If there are falsehood and exaggeration in the 
                    statements of their opponents, surely it would 
                    be easy to expose the falsehood and to miti-
                    gate the exaggeration. To do this Mr. Armour 
                    makes no attempt. He finds it wiser in dithy-
                    rambic strains to hymn the glories of his craft. 
                    He represents himself as an Atlas, who bears 
                    upon his shoulders the industry of America. 
                    If we may believe him, “nothing short of the 
                    vast and highly organised packing industry as 
                    it stands today, with its immense capital and 
                    its immense and constant demand for raw 
                    material, could sustain so greet an agricultural 
                    business as that of the combined corn-growing 
                    and corn feeding industry.” And when he 
                    reflects on the economic progress made possible 
                    by the by-products of meat-packing, his voice
                    quivers with emotion. “It is impossible,” he 
                    exclaims, “to realise the extent to which this
                    touches every physical element in our every-
                    day life—from making worn-out and barren 
                    lands yield bounteous crops to supplying the 
                    buttons on our coats.”</p>
                    <p>Such rhetoric as this will not help the cause 
                    of the packers. And we can only advise Mr. 
                    Armour, in the slang of his own Chicago, to 
                    “let go the flying rings, and get back to the 
                    green earth”</p>
                    <p>Poetry (or is it “guff”?) cannot reassure us. 
                    The one thing needed to allay the public sus-
                    picion is a rigorous and honourable inspection, 
                    which can neither be shirked nor evaded. Mr. 
                    Armour says that it pays the packer to be 
                    honest. That it not enough. Before we will 
                    buy the packer’s wares again the law of the 
                    United States must see to it that the packer 
                    is honest whether it pays him or not.</p>
                    <p>If further proof is needed of what the 
                    London Press think of Mr. Armour’s publica-
                    tion, we append an extract from the “Morn-
                    ing Post” :</p>
                    <p>With regard to the “Jungle” revelations Mr. 
                    Armour hardly gives himself space for more 
                    than direct denials. In his own business “not 
                    one atom of any condemned animal or carcass 
                    finds its way, directly or indirectly, from any 
                    source into any food-product or food-ingre-
                    dient.” It is very difficult for the British 
                    public without sworn evidence before them 
                    either to accept or to reject this assertion off-
                    hand. But they will certainly not be convinc-
                    ed by any mere assertions either that the 
                    self-interest of the packer will compel clean-
                    liness even without inspection, or that there is 
                    efficient inspection because a Government in-
                    spector is appointed. The British public know 
                    by their own experience that though ultimately 
                    sound business may prove to be the best 
                    business, yet large interim profits may be made, 
                    and will be made, by unsound business ; that 
                    bad food, bad milk, bad houses may and will 
                    be supplied at the expense of the people’s 
                    health, unless the State takes measurer to 
                    prevent it by positive regulation. They know 
                    also by their own experience that regulation is 
                    useless without efficient inspection, and that 
                    efficient inspection is very hard to secure. 
                    These things the British public know. What 
                    they want to know further is this: Why did 
                    the American packing firms resist tooth and 
                    nail Mr. Roosevelt’s recent proposals for 
                    making inspection effective? That question 
                    is not answered at all by Mr. Armour. Till 
                    it is answered satisfactorily the case against 
                    the packing firms remains unrefuted.</p>

                    <p>“I hope that in a few years I may into-
                    doce to the Mohamedan world a number of 
                    young men of whom the Egyptian nation

                    and civilisation, of the enormity of their 
                    error. I venture to make each a state-
                    ment, as I hear the local press calling upon 
                    the Egyptians to avail themselves of public 
                    instruction. They desire education to spread aid 
                    to grow more and more, while I desire that 
                    education to be based on the Moslem religion,

                    been ousted from Rhodes ; and they it was who

                    <head>WASTA TO MINIEH DOUBLING.</head>
                    <p>The important undertaking of doubling the 
                    line between Wasta and Minieh is making 
                    good progress, and it is hoped that 40 or 50 
                    kilometres of double track will be put into 
                    service towards the end of this year. In addition 
                    to the doubling of the line, this work comprises 
                    the alteration and improvement of twenty 
                    stations. In regard to the expropriations, the 
                    land necessary for the new stations and plate-
                    layers' huta only has been purchased, the exist-
                    ing railway property being in all cases sufficient 
                    for the line itself. The total area purchased 
                    in 1905 was 56 feddans, at an average price 
                    L.E. 113. or L.E. 6,328 in all.</p>
                    <p>204,100 cubic metres of earth-filling has been 
                    done in widening the bank for double track, 
                    and 490,200 cubic metres for alteration to 
                    stations. The total amount of earthwork was 
                    694,300 cubic metres, of which 45% was trans-
                    ported by train, and the remainder obtained 
                    from borrow pits.</p>
                    <p>At Wasta Station all the building works 
                    have been completed, except three pits and 
                    the ironwork of the locomotive shed. At 
                    seventeen other stations the buildings have 
                    either been completed or are in hand. At 
                    Minieh one platform has been completed, as 
                    well as lodgings for the traffic, locomotive and 
                    permanent way staff. Foundatinns for the 
                    remaining buildings are in hand. 4.500 metres 
                    of track have been laid at this station, and 
                    142,600 cubic metres of filling have been done. 
                    The amount expended under this head during 
                    1905 was L.E. 97,597.</p>

                    <head>TRADE WITH THE SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>The Director of Customs in the Sudan, with 
                    a view to assisting merchants and intending 
                    traders, has issued the following statement :—
                    "Merchants should be careful to see that if 
                    lighterage or landing charges are levied, they 
                    are included in the freight rate.</p>
                   <p> “All goods should be well packed, and the 
                    final destination marked in clear letters 
                    together with the port of discharge.</p>
                    <p>"Multiplicity of marks should be avoided ; 
                    most of the goods received from Egypt being 
                    packed in old cases, have three or four destina-
                    tions marked on the packages, and wrong 
                    delivery is an almost constant complaint.</p>
                    <p>"Whisky, liquors, and provisions should be 
                    packed in screw-fastened, iron-bound cases, 
                    the increaeed cost of packing being amply 
                    justified by the decrease in breakages and pil-
                    ferages. Sugar should also be packed in iron-
                    bound cases ; the present cases are useless for 
                    camel transit, and do not stand ordinary 
                    handling.</p>
                    <p>“Bales of cotton should not exceed 500 kilos. 
                    in weight, and under no circumstances should 
                    bales over this size be shipped, unless specially 
                    ordered.</p>
                    <p>“The Customs being <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi>, shippers

                    own representatives."</p>
                    <p>Among the items mostly required may be 
                    noted the following :-</p>
                    <p>Galvanized iron (water and oil) tanks find a 
                    ready sale, as also safes Tanks could be 
                    utilised for packing purposes with advantage.</p>
                    <p>Brass water taps. - Good quality recommend-
                    ed, as at present imports are of very inferior

                    <p>Iron locks, keys, door knobs. —A very cheap

                        business of selling condemned and diseased meat

                        from day to day. The British public have taken 
                        the alleged exposures very much to heart,and it 
                        is the duty of the Press to restore public confi-

                        results of Government investigations of 
                        Chicago packing, showing that the foods 
                        issued by Messrs. Armour and Company are 
                        above reproach and that the public may con-

                        establishment without the slightest shade of 
                        anxiety.</p>
                       <p> In view of all these circumstances, and of 
                        the fact that the prevalent abuse is largely 
                        the result of the example set by many of our 
                        leading newspapers, would it not be a worthy

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette ”</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Referring to the rather strange article 
                        signed “Sanitas.” about tinned meats, which 
                        appeared in your issue of yesterday, we beg 
                        to point out that there is no truth whatever 
                        in the scandalous stories which have been 
                        published about the Chicago packing houses. 
                        "Sanitas” seems to have been led away by 
                        the "Yellow" journals, who ears for nothing 
                        but the publication of something sensational, 
                        in order to increase their circulation.</p>
                        <p>We hold at the disposal of "Sanitas” the 
                        extract from the Report of the Committee of 
                        the U. S. Department of Agriculture, showing 
                        that the charges brought up by the "Jungle" 
                        are all false. This journal who talks lightly 
                        does not seem to realise that a violation 
                        entails on employer and employee a penalty 
                        of 12 months' imprisonment and a fine of 1000 
                        dollars for each offence.</p>
                        <p>The Medical Magazine, edited by Mr. A. 
                        G. Auld, M.D., M.R.C.P, of London, writes as 
                        follows :—</p>
                        <p>“ The presumption that the foods issued 
                        "by Messrs. Armour &amp; Company of Chicago 
                        "etc., were objectionable is prima facie 
                        "absurd, and now that we have incontrover-
                        “tible proof that the most scrupulous care 
                        "is taken, the public may consume the 
                        "canned meats provisions coming from this 
                        “firm without the slightest shade of anxiety. 
                        “For our part we should say that it is much 
                        "safer to eat canned meats which may contain 
                        "a mere atom of foreign substances, than 
                        "to partake of most of the stuff exposed 
                        "fur sale in butchers' shops."</p>
                        <p>The fact that 30 millions of tins of preserved 
                        food are consumed annually in the United 
                        Kingdom and that no well founded cases have 
                        been proved a danger to health is in itself 
                        an evidence daring all these years that there 
                        could not been much dangerous food exported 
                        as some people may believe.</p>
                        <p>Facts are that President Roosevelt’s inve-
                        stigations show Armours's Products to be 
                        above reproach. Armours' guarantee goes with 
                        every tin.</p>
                        <p>This, we hope, will enable you to remove 
                        all stories against American canned meats.</p>

                    fight, not to surrender." He got hit commision

                    Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, then 
                    embodied, joined the regiment at the front

                    the loss of a single rifle, and the brave officer

                        <p>To the Editor or the "Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Although Egypt had for long been 
                            steeped in an ignorance which threatened to 
                            erase the reminiscences of her glorious past, yet 
                            circumstances have pitied our social situation 
                            by sending as reformers who after diagnosing 
                            our disease prescribed an effic cions remedy. 
                            They discovered that the main factor of this 
                            backwardness was the neglect of the education 
                            of lower class Egyptians, so that the contrast 
                            between the poor illiterates and the educated 
                            led to misunderstandings. They realised that 
                            the best means of avoiding such prevailing 
                            misapprehension was the education of that 
                            populace.</p>
                        <p>These reformers began, therefore, to devise 
                            ways and means, starting with the village 
                            Kuttabs scattered throughout the country. 
                            This task Government placed in the hands 
                            of the Ministry of Public Instruction, which 
                            drew up for the purpose a special scheme under 
                            the heading of the 'Kuttab Contribution.’</p>
                        <p>This scheme entitled the Fiki of a Kuttab, 
                            who is subject to the Ministry, to an annual 
                            subsidy.</p>
                        <p>Experiences and capable masters from the 
                            Arabic Training College were therefore selec-
                            ted to inspect the Kuttabs that were put under 
                            the care of the Ministry and to instruct the 
                            ‘fikis' how to teach, organise, and manage. The 
                            inspectors did their duties so well that the 
                            number of Kuttabs subject to the Ministry's 
                            inspection began to rise gradually, amounting 
                            this year to 4,400 Kuttabs.</p>
                        <p>With the object of further improvement the 
                            Ministry decided that these village school 
                            masters should know something more than the 
                            Koran. They decided to give them private tui-

                            ship are now thoroughly taught by the masters 
                            of the Government Schools is the different 
                            centres. An annual examination is held in the 
                            various centres. Successful candidates receive 
                            either Fiki or teacher’s certificate for two-
                            thirds of the total marks, or an “Aril” (pupil 
                            Fiki) Certificate for one third of the maximum 
                            marks.</p>
                        <p>In the examination this year more than 500 
                            fikis and arifs were successful. Certificates 
                            entitle holder to employ in the organised kuttabs 
                            belonging to the Ministry, to a monthly salary, 
                            and to exemption from military service during 
                            such employ. The Ministry of Instraction 
                            feeling that the numbers of successful can-
                            didates graduated every year does not meet 
                            the requirements of the kuttabs, decided lately 
                            to establish day schools for masters and mis-
                            tresses of kuttabs. A couple of years ago it 
                            founded the Abdel Aziz School at Cairo; last 
                            year one at Fayoum was opened, and one this 
                            year at Kaioab. It is, however, expected that 
                            in course of time more schools will be erected. 
                            The natives feeling the benefit of this scheme 
                            supported the Ministry with all their might. 
                            Almost every notable, singly or with the help 
                            of his fellow villagers built a new kuttab on 
                            plans made by the Inspector in the most 
                            hygienic spot As a headmaster of a 
                            national school in Lower Egypt the writer 
                            visited many a recently built kuttab. Besides 
                            being well built they contain ample accommoda-
                            tion and the rooms are well aired. The <unclear/> 
                            which prevailed that the great cities of Egypt 
                            set an example of model kuttab building is 
                            wrong, for although satisfied with the educa-
                            ion, training and discipline, the writer found
                            sanitary conditions very indifferent. Indeed
                            on more than one occasion, he mentioned the
                            matter to the Alexandria kuttab Inspector.
                            This at length had the desired effect and
                            by order of the Municipality the walls were
                            lime washed and sanitary inspectors paid
                            frequent visits to these kuttabs and sent
                            reports which paves the way for further
                            reforms.</p>
                        <p>The daily reports given by the vernacular
                            papers announcing the inauguration cere-
                            monies of kuttabs in various localities, will, I
                            believe support my idea and put me in such a
                            position as to draw the attention of the

                    <head>TURKEY’S REPORTED CHANGE OF ATTITUDE.</head>
                    <p>Prominent delegates at the Lesser Zionist 
                        congress now in session at Cologne consider it 
                        likely (the “Evening Standard" says) that Mr. 
                        Israel Zangwill, who at last year’s congress 
                        headed the “Ito," a "Territorialist” section, 
                        which deserted the Zionist movement after rio-
                        tous discussions, will before long again take
                        stand beneath the Zionist banner.</p>
                    <p>The territorialists, it will be remembered, 
                        favoured the immediate acceptance and colo-
                        nisation of the South African territory offered 
                        by the British Government rather than wait an 
                        indefinite period for the realisation of the 
                        Zionist dream of regaining Palestine itself.</p>
                    <p>Prominent Zionists, including Dr. Max 
                        Nordau and President David Wolfssohn, have 
                        stated at the present Congress that there is 
                        every probability of Turkey acceding within 
                        measurable time to the Zionist plea to be al-
                        lowed to colouise Palestine.</p>
                    <p>The only obstacle in the way of the Zionist 
                        aspirations is the fact that Turkey, which has 
                        been compelled to face such an epidemic of 
                        problems of late, fears the growth of a supple-
                        mentary Jewish quest on, and is therefore in a 
                        state of uncertainty as to what attitude to 
                        take towards the Zionist claim. President 
                        Wolfssohn states, however, that there is no 
                        semblance of truth in the assertion that 
                        the Jews once in possession of the territory, 
                        would work towards the establishment of a re-
                        public or a monarchy in Palestine.</p>
                    <p>“Theodore Herzl, the dead founder and 
                        leader of our movement," says President 
                        Wolfssohn, "might, by the aid of his powerful 
                        personality, have stood at the head of a 
                        Jewish monarchy but with his death Jewish 
                        monarchical government would have simul-
                        taneously come to an end.”</p>
                    <p>The leaders of Zionism to-day agree that 
                        peaceable, free development under the suzer-
                        ainty of Turkey is preferable to taking upon 
                        their shoulders all the huge responsibilities 
                        which the establishment of an independent 
                        government would involve.</p>

                        bereavement which he ban sustained by the 
                        death of his wife, which took place yesterday 
                        afternoon at Marienbad. Party feeling is some
                        times strong and occasionally even bitter in 
                        this country, but we are glad to think that it 
                        never impairs the kindly relations which exist 
                        between our public men, or the friendly inte-
                        rest which we all take in the domestic joys 
                        and sorrows of our statesmen. Nothing can

                        the first days after it has fallen ; but such 
                        measure of solace as the assurance of the 
                        profound and genuine sympathy of all parties

                        <p>A strong objection to the Roosevelt spell-
                        ing scheme has not yet been noticed. That is, 
                        that it opens the door to a state of perpe-
                        tual uncertainty and unrest in questions of 
                        orthography. The official list of 300 words 
                        is admittedly--even ludicrously—incomplete, 
                        and must be merely the first of many instal-
                        ments. Suppose we have a new hatch of 300 
                        words for every succecding American Presi-
                        dent. What is likely to be the state of mind 
                        of the average American citizen at the end of 
                        ten years? The position of the Englishman 
                        who has to keep himself abreast of a list of 
                        new titles every Birthday and New Year, so 
                        as not to confuse Lord St. Aldwyn with Lord 
                        Selby or Lord Knaresborough, is but a faint

                        thought that the Labour members would have

                        <p>Despite the veneer, there is a good deal of 
                        the savage is us all. There are hundreds of 
                        thousands of people who don't know, but are 
                        constantly striving to get back to a more 
                        natural condition. You go a walk in the 
                        country, you go out shooting, you go to 
                        Switzerland and climb hills. You call it a 
                        holiday, but the cause of the enjoyment is 
                        that the real man—the primeval ancestor in 
                        you—is coming into his own, is feeling in a 
                        natural element —(Dr. Nansen, in "London

                        <head>The Boulevards of Paris.</head>
                        <p>The boulevards were once to Paris what 
                        long hair was to Samson—its secret and 
                        strength. Paris, in telling its secret to the 
                        whole world, lost a large part of its intellectual 
                        camaraderie. The life of the boulevards was as 
                        kind of social intimacy carried on in public ; 
                        the cafés were clubs, and privilege was firmly 
                        established in them, even though every seat 
                        seemed to be public. But a generation has 
                        changed that. The intimacy, which was a 
                        strange mixture of Bohemianism, artistic fel-
                        lowship, civic and professional rapport, and 
                        the need for a political debating ground, has 
                        been swallowed by the publicity (become 
                        trebly public) which once protected it. It is as 
                        though an old fashioned English inn had been 
                        turned into a brand-new, brawling, gaudy 
                        hotel with all the "latest improvements” for 
                        doing away with the zest and flavour of life.

                        <p>Any one of the large London or American 
                        daily papers consumes each day fully ten acres 
                        of an average forest. Such paper does not 
                        last. The wood fibre out of which it is made 
                        is, unlike pure cellulose, acted upon by light 
                        and air, and water and the organisms of decay. 
                        This is bad, but not wholly bad, for most of 
                        the literature appearing on this paper is made 
                        as mechanically as the paper itself, and it is 
                        fitting it should be as ephemeral in fact as it 
                        is in nature. But sometimes Literature (with 
                        a capital “L”) appears on this wooden founda-
