					<head>THE ROUTES FROM SYRIA</head>
					<p>Syria his troops took three and-a-half days to cover the distance from Katieh to El Arish
						and three from El Arish to Gaza. In his time there were six wells at El Arish, and in his
						opinion 20,000 men could be collected there. The following extract from his Commentaries is of
						interest</p>
					<p>Generals who have marched from Egypt to Syria or from Syria to Egypt have in all periods of
						history considered this desert the greater obstacle the larger the number of horses they took
						with them. The ancient historians declare that when Cambyses wished to penetrate into Egypt he
						made an alliance with an Arab King, who caused a canal to flow with water in the desert, which
						evidently means that he covered it with camels bearing water. Alexander sought to please the
						Jews so that they might help him in the passage of the desert. This obstacle, however, was not
						so great in ancient times as it is to-day, since towns and villages existed, and the industry
						of man contended with success against the difficulties. To-day scarcely anything remains
						between Salihiyeh and Gaza. An army must, therefore, cross the desert successively by forming
						establishments and magazines at Salihiyeh, Katieh, and El Arish. If this army start from Syria
						it most first of all form a large magazine at El Arish and then carry it forward to Katieh.
						But these operations are slow, and they give an enemy time to make his preparations for
						defense. . . . An army detending Egypt can either assemble at El Arish to oppose the
						investment of this place, or at Katieh to raise the siege of El Arish or at Salihiyeh; all
						these alternatives offer advantages. Of all obstacles which may cover the frontiers of
						empires, a desert like this is incontestably the greatest Mountains like the Alps take second
						rank, and rivers the third. If there is so much difficulty in carrying the food of an army
						that complete success is rarely obtained, this difficulty becomes twenty times greater when it
						is necessary to carry water, forage,and fuel, three things which are weighty, difficult to
						carry, and usually found by armies upon the ground they occupy.</p>
					<p>The southern route is <hi rend="italic">vid</hi> Akaba to Suez. It is little used since the
						chief pilgrim traffic became diverted to the sea, but there is believed to be water at Bir-eth
						Themed, 35 miles from Akaba, a good supply at Nakhl, 40 miles further west, and wells at
						Meibeluk, 14 miles from Suez. This route traverses the mountains for a distance of 20 miles in
						the neighbourhood of Nakhl.</p>
					<p>The southern caravan route is not exposed to attack from seaward save at its two
						extremities, Akaba and Suez. The Gulf of Akaba is the continuation of the great depression in
						which lie the Jordan and the Dead Sea. The head of the gulf forms a circular bay, with a low
						and sandy shore forming the end of the Wady el Akaba, which is flanked on each side by lofty
						mountains. The village of Akaba stands on the eastern shore at the head of the golf Ships can
						anchor in 11 fathoms close inshore and only two cables from the Turkish fort, with good
						protection in northerly winds. The distance by Akaba through Nakhl to Suez is 150 miles. The
						alternative route <hi rend="italic">vid</hi> Rafah, El Arish to El Kantara is 143 miles. From
						Rafah to El Arish the ground is sandy and water is found only at Sheikh el Zauieh, 22 miles
						from El Arish. This latter own is situated among palm groves a mile and three quarters from
						the beach, and it possesses numerous wells. From El Arit-h to Bir el Maza the distance is 32
						miles and the going usually sourd. At El Maza there is only one well, 35ft. deep, with 6ft. of
						water. From Bir el Maza the distance is 31 miles over soft sandy desert to Bir el Abd, where
						there is a considerable supply ot water from wells. Katieh is 17 miles further west, and here
						there is a large well with 6ft. of water at a depth of 20ft., while a good supply of drinkable
						water can be found by digging at a depth of 10ft to 20ft below the surface. From Katieh to El
						Kantara, 33 miles, the road traverses first a marshy plain, then a long reach of holding
						sand-dunes, and finally 16 miles of good hard desert. El Kantara is on the east bank of the
						Suez Canal and is supplied by water from the Fresh Water Canal by means of a pipe which passes
						under the Suez Canal. The worst part of this route is that between El Arith and Bir el Abd, 63
						miles, with a single well half way. d The section of the Mediterranean ooe-t which flanks the
						road from El Arish to El Kantara is low and dangerous, offering few facilities for a
						disembarkation. At the head of the Bay of Pelusium, east of the Suez Canal, the five-fathom
						line is six-and a-half miles from the beach. 8andbanks are nume</p>
					<p>rous, the shore is almost dead flat, and the only remarkable feature that can be
						distinguished from seaward at a distance of over three miles is the sandhill of Ras Kasrun,
						270ft. high, and rather more than halfway between the Suez Canal and El Arish. For some 50
						miles, with Ras Kasrun as a centre, a long strip of reef-like sand separates an interior
						lagoon, Lake Sirbon, from the sea. This lagoon is from two to six miles broad. It ends about
						17 miles west of El Arish, where the shallows also end, and the five- fathom line is only half
						a mile from the shore, Thus Lake Sirbon and the shallows of the Bey of Pelusium partially
						cover the sea flank of an army traversing the desert,aud it is only in the vicinity of El
						Arish that a naval force can effect anything serious until the Suez Canal is reached, and in
						the Canal only by ships with guns mounted at sufficient height to fire over the banks.</p>
					<p>Thus, concludes a military correspondent of the “Times,” from whom the above facts are
						taken, the two main caravan routes leading to Egypt from the eastward both start from points
						where sea power can exercise important influence ; both traverse some 150 miles of desert
						where sea power oan effect little, and each is broken by a single set of wells approximately
						half-way across the desert.</p>

					<p> AN AMUSING EPISODE, </p>
					<p>DELEGATES SWIM ASHORE.</p>
					<p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
					<p>Port Said, Thursday.</p>
					<p>As I wired you to-day, H.M.S. Minerva returned here this morning at six o’clock, after
						having been to sea since last Saturday. The rumours which were current, to the effect that the
						went out to assist a ship in distress, were without foundation, as she went to rejoin the
						fleet.</p>
					<p>Admiral Lambton arrived on board the Minerva this morning, and proceeded to Cairo by the
						midday train to report to Lord Cromer. He is expected to return to-morrow, when the Minerva
						will leave immediately. In the meantime the vessel is coaling.</p>
					<p>The Minerva is and has been in wireless communication with the fleet for some time. several
						men-of-war have been reported during the last 48 hours. There are three in the harbour at
						present. Flash lights were used all last night by the Thetis.</p>
					<p>When H M S. Minerva was at Arish with the delegates on the last occasion, they found that it
						was impossible to land in boats, and a ter many attempts they were obliged to dispense with
						their clothing and take to the water, arriving on shore minus a good deal of clothing. Several
						attempts were made to send their clothes ashore in casks, but all were unsuccessful. The
						delegates were obliged to ride for 17 miles with practically nothing on, arriving at El Arish
						covered with mosquito bites and well burnt by the sun.</p>
					<p>PREPARING FOR ACTION.</p>
					<p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
					<p>Port 8aid, Friday.</p>
					<p>H M.S. Minerva is constructing extra fighting tops and is preparing for action.</p>
					<p>THE NOUR EL BAHR.</p>
					<p>( From our Correspondent ).</p>
					<p>Suez, Thursday.</p>
					<p>Captain Potts, commander of H.H.S. Nour el Bahr, proceeded yesterday evening to Cairo,
						apparently to receive, and convey to H.M.S. Diana at Akaha, final instructions before the
						expiration of the ultimatum. The Nour el Bahr is expected to fail hence very shortly.</p>
					<p>Official negotiations regarding the frontier are proceeding and hopes of a satisfactory
						settlement of the dispute are now entertained. Admiral Lambton left Cairo this morning in
						order to rejoin H.M.S. Minerva.</p>
					<p>The news of the coming of the fleet is having a great effect. Malta is bereft of men-of-war
						for all the ships in the Mediterranean Fleet,except the Prince of Wales, the Venerable, and
						the London, which are in dockyard hands at Malta, have left there.</p>
					<p>At this morning’s prayers at the Mosques in Alexandria there was the large attendance usual
						on Fridays, but we understand there were no inflammatory harangues.</p>
					<p>ARRIVAL OF TROOPS.</p>
					<p>The hired transport Dilwara arrived at Alexandria this morning from Malta with the 4th
						Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment, which immediately landed and marched to Mustapha
						Pacha barracks, where they will be quartered. The troops will be placed under camp.</p>
					<p>The 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and "U” Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, have embarked on the
						Leyland Line S S. Cestrian for Alexandria, and are due to arrive here on the 24th inst.</p>
					<p>A CONFESSION OF WEAKNESS.</p>
					<p>It is considered that the Government’s</p>
					<p>answer in both Houses of Parliament on Tuesday week is to be regretted, as a joint
						delimitation of the frontier of Egypt on the Sinaitic side will he interpreted as a confession
						of weakness and will possibly keep the question open for years owing to the dilatory tactics
						of the Turks.</p>
					<p>EGYPT AND TURKEY.</p>
					<p> GERMAN OPINION. </p>
					<p>The Berlin correspondent of the "Tribune" says there is every reason to believe that the
						stubbornness which is being exhibited by the Porte depends largely on the real or imaginary
						support of Germany, in view of certain advantages to German commerce which may be likely to he
						gained by a strong support of the Sultan at the present juncture. He continues as follows :
						—</p>
					<p>“I have repeatedly had occasion to call attention to the growth of German interest in Asia
						Minor, and especially in Palestine, an illustration of which is furnished by the establishment
						of definite German proprietary rights to the site known as the Dormitio Virginia The growth of
						German interests and influence at Constantinople bad its origin in the energetic
						representations made by General Von der Goltz, who initiated the railway policy after his
						visit to Turkey in 1882 in connection with the reorganization of the Turkish Army. General Von
						der Goltz repeatedly advocated the polioy of fortifying the Turk in his Eastern dominions.
						persuading the Sultan to abandon his European African, and Asiatic possessions, and to
						establish himself in Anatolia, having Mesopotamia as a background.</p>
					<p>“This, or something similar, is the German policy regarding Turkey. Thus much is plainly
						shown by the fact Germany strongly ad­</p>
					<p>vised the Sultan to accommodate himself to the Anglo-Egyptian demands regarding the Sinaitic
						Peninsula. The German Press is perfectly justified in The conviction that it forms no part of
						German policy to support the Sultan in a hopeless opposition to England regarding the
						ownership of Tabah or of similar unimportant trifles. Nor are German interests in Egypt
						sufficiently strong to make the Kaiser’s Government hope that commercial results will accrue
						there from diplomatic action at Constantinople. This is clearly shown in an article which
						appeared recently by Dr. Preyer, of the German Consulate at Cairo. . . . Nevertheless, it is
						very desirable that Germany should make it clear to the Sultan that the lines he has adopted
						do not meet German approval.”</p>
					<p>The Berlin correspondent of a London contemporary remarks that in several quarters there is
						a disposition shown to advocate the transference of the Akaba question to the decision of some
						sort of international congress, The question, it is maintained, affects other Powers besides
						those immediately concerned, and it must not be decided in such a way that the future of this
						region will be entirely in Anglo-Egyptian keeping.</p>
					<p>SULTAN AND KAISER.</p>
					<p>The “Pyramides” states that it has received the following communication from its
						Constantinople correspondent dated the 2nd May :—</p>
					<p>J’apprends de source sûre -et c’est un bruit qui court dans les cercles impartiaux turcs
						avec persistance—que le baron Marschall, ambassadeur d’Allemagne, an cours d’une audience
						qu’il eut, an Novembre, du Sultan, conseilla vivement au Souverain, de ne tenir aucun compte
						des réclamations Anglo-Egyptiennes relativement à l’occupation de Tabah, et de résister.
						L’Allemagne — aurait suggéré l’am­bassadeur—était prête à soutenir par tous les moyens les
						prétentions turques, lesquelles seraient appuyées par que’que autre puissance.</p>
					<p>L’Allemagne aurait changé depuis de langage.</p>
					<p>Dans une audience que M. de Marschall a eue, ces jours derniers, du Sultan,il aurait
						conseillé à ce dernier par des circonlocutions plus on moins habiles, que la Turquie devait
						céder, la situation internationale ayant subi ces derniers temps de grands changements.</p>
					<p>On ajoute tout bas que le Sultan a été à ce point mal impressionné par le langage du re-
						présentant de l’empereur Guillaume, que, sans dire un mot, il s’est levé et a congédié du
						geste son interlocuteur.</p>
					<p>De grands échanges de dépêches ont lieu en ce moment entre Berlin et Constantinople
						relativement a ce pénible incident. Les relations entre les deux pays sont depuis devenues
						d'une extrême froideur entre les Allemands et les Turcs.</p>
					<p>MUSSULMANS AND THE DISPUTE.</p>
					<p>THE YEMEN REBELLION.</p>
					<p> FEIZI PACHA ASKS FOR 30,000 MORE TROOPS. </p>
					<p>situation almost hopeless</p>
					<p>( Gazette's Special Serví'</p>
					<p>London Friday, Telegrams from Constantinople say that news from the Yemen describes the
						situation of the Turkish troops as being well-nigh hopeless. According to all appearances, the
						Yemen will be lost before long to Turkish rule.</p>
					<p>The rebellion in the Yemen seems to 1 still to the fore. On Tuesday 1,200 Turkish troops
						from Constantinople passed through Port Said on the transport Abdel-Kader en route for
						Hodeidah. It is rumoured that Feizi Pacha has asked for 30,000 more troops and that these are
						being passed overland from Syria to ports on the coast of the Red Sea.</p>
					<p>The report that the distinguished Turkish General was severely wounded was evidently untrue.
						It is said that his troops have endured great hardships in the Yemen, and that they have been
						forced to abandon many positions in the interior.</p>
					<p>Articles in the "German Post” and the "National Zeitung” accuse England of a desire to see
						Turkey humiliated and defeated in Southern Arabia in her attempt to crush the rebellion in the
						Yemen.</p>
					<p>According to these German papers, in the event of the Arab tribes being successful, England
						will find it easy to increase her territory in the hinterland of Aden. With her increased
						influence in Arabia she will then be able to counteract German projects in Asia Minor and
						hinder the completion of the Bagdad Railway.</p>
					<p>It is generally found on investigation that the rumours of German expeditions into different
						parts of Asia Minor and Syria are mere concoctions of people wishful to make trouble. Either
						they are found innocent German professors of archaeology or not Germans at all, as in the case
						of some Jews who recently landed in Syria.</p>
					<p>SULTAN’S HEIR REPORTED DEAD.</p>
					<p>A Dalziel Constantinople message states that the brother of the Sultan, Reshad Effendi, heir
						presumptive to the Throne, is reported to have died. His successor will probably he
						Burhaneddiue Effendi, youngest son of the Sultan.</p>
					<p>It is remarkable that some dire calamity should always befall the Imperial Ottoman Family
						whenever any hitch takes place in Turkey’s foreign affairs. A frontier squabble, or a drop in
						the funds, or merely the departure of a British warship is quite enough to bury the Saltan,
						and his heirs.</p>
					<p>THE KHEDIVE.</p>
					<p>The Khedive attended Friday prayers to­day at the Mosque of Sidi El-Bassiri,</p>
					<p>PATRIOTISM IN EGYPT.</p>
					<p>Were not patriotism, writes an Egyptian effendi in the “Mcayad,” a sort of pet phrase with
						some of the local native papers, all this hue and cry about Akaha would never have been raised
						in Egypt. The occupation of positions beyond her border can by no means benefit Turkey, nor
						any other Power, barring England, How can Turkey now, in 1906, hope to annex, the Sinaitic
						Peninsula, which she could not do in 1892, when Great Britain’s position in Egypt was not so
						firm as it is to-day ? Blatant patriotism such as this has more than once brought down trouble
						upon the country, and the Moslems should seek to avoid a third visitation of the kind.</p>
					<p>EGYPTIAN CONSTRUCTIONS.</p>
					<p>The first ordinary (or statutory) meeting of the Egyptian Constructions, Limited, was held
						yesterday at the offices of the company in Cairo, 86,875 shares being represented. The
						Secretary having read the notice convening the meeting, the Chairman made the following brief
						remarks</p>
					<p>Referring to the statutory report of the directors, of which yon have doubtless all received
						a copy, it may interest you to know that the total number of shares applied for was 863,499
						and the amount deposited upon application at the bank was £129,524.17s. A list of the
						applications and allotments is on the table for your inspection. An official quotation of oar
						shares was granted by the Cairo Bourse on the 14th March. Although we have but recently
						formally acquired the businesses from the vendors they have been conducted on our behalf since
						the 1st October last, and I am delighted to he able to inform yon that the prospects of the
						company have even exceeded our anticipations. Among the principal contracts we already have in
						band are for the following :—Egyptian State Railways,Egyptian Estates, Ltd., Savoy Chambers,
						Savoy Hotel annexe, Cairo, and a number of private residences in the suburbs of Cairo and
						Alexandria, and in addition to these we are negotiating, and have every project of obtaining,
						several other very important contracts.</p>
					<p>The proceedings terminated with a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman.</p>
					<p>THE PLAGUE.</p>
					<p>Two fresh cases of plague and a recovery were reported from Samalont and a death from Deshna
						yesterday. Today’s bulletin records a case at Samalout and a death at Deshna.</p>
					<p>W A.A.G. FOR EGYPT.</p>
					<p> COL. CUTHBERT APPOINTED. </p>
					<p>(Gazette's Special Service.)</p>
					<p>London, Friday.</p>
					<p>It is stated that Colonel Cuthbert has been appointed Assistant Adjutant General on the
						Egyptian Staff. He leaves for Egypt almost immediately.</p>
					<p>MARS A MATROUH.</p>
					<p>The Ministry of the Interior has decided to divide Marsa-Matrouh into two markazes, named,
						respectively, Marsa-Matrouh and Al- Daliaa. The latter is to begin from Al-Amaid to Maghrah on
						the East, and from Mursi, in a line extending from North to South, on the West. The
						Marsa-Matrouh markaz will extend from Al Daba to Soloum. The two markazes will be placed under
						the Behera Moudirieh for administrative purposes, and under the</p>
					<p>Alexandria Gouvernorat as regards public security. An officer of the Coastguard
						Administration will be appointed Mainour of Al- Daliaa markaz.</p>
					<p>ARCHÆOLOGIGAL SURVEY</p>
					<p> OF EGYPT.</p>
					<p>The fifteenth memoir of the Archaeological Survey of Egypt deals with the tombs of Huya and
						Ahmes at Tel-el-Amarna. It reveals ones more, despite the enormous apparent differences, how
						unchanged in essentials is the world of to-day from that of the Pharaohs. This memoir the pen
						of Mr. N. de Garie Davies, is both learned and literary. The story of these long-since
						departed shades is vividly retold from the carved records remaining. Even the "graffiti” of
						Greek visitors are 2,000 years old. Concerning these, Mr. Seymour de Ricci discourses in an
						appendix. To the text are added forty large plates in which the extant pictures on the walls
						of the tombs are dearly distinguishable from any restorations indicated.</p>
					<p>INTERNAL EXCHANGE.</p>
					<p>The fact that there is an internal exchange in Egypt, Lord Cromer remarks in bis Report, is
						a natural consequence of the general use of actual coin in the settlement of transactions in
						the interior of the country. It can only be broken down by the extended employment of
						instruments of credit for this purpose, such as the bank notes themselves, and by the growth
						of deposit banking. In more advanced communities, the confidence in bank notes is so great,
						and, the banking system so widely developed, as to render feasible the payment of the notes
						all over the country, Thus, in Scotland and Canada, the banks redeem each other’s notes
						mutually, although the distances in the latter country are very great. In England, although
						the Bank of England notes are legally payable only at the place of issue and in London, they
						are accepted in practice without difficulty at other offices if tendered by customers. In
						Germany, the Reichsbank, under ordinary circumstances, pays its notes at its branches, and
						every independent bank is required to redeem its notes at an agency in Berlin or Frankfurt. In
						India, on the other hand, where the internal exchange plays a large part in the commerce of
						the country, the Government notes are redeemable only at the plaoe of issue or at the chief
						town of the Presidency where they are issued. There is happily reason to believe that the
						conditions of Egypt tend rather in the direction of assimilation to those existing in European
						countries.</p>
					<p>EGYPTIAN BANKING STATISTICS.</p>
					<p>The amount of the share capital and reserves of the purely Egyptian deposit banks has
						increased from 2,939,000/ in 1901 to 6,300,000l. in 1905. The conjecture may safely be
						hazarded that, were it possible to ascertain the figures relating to the Egyptian business of
						the foreign banks, somewhat similar progressive movements would be exhibited. The same remark
						applies to the case of private banking firms, of which there are a considerable number. The
						accountants of these latter are not published.</p>
					<p>The total liabilities of the purely Egyptian deposit banks have increased from 7,456,000l.
						in 1901 to 19,604,000l in 1905, and the total assets have, daring the same period, increased
						from 10,595,000l. to 26,424,000/.</p>
					<p>THE TARBUSH TRADE.</p>
					<p>The following extract from Colonel Stanton’s Report on the administration of Khartoum may be
						of interest to British traders :—</p>
					<p>“There is an increased demand for Man­chester goods cheap cutlery, &amp;c. It is a pity that
						some British firm does not attempt to make tarbushes. At present, this trade is entirely in
						the hands of Austrian firms. The material of both the Turkish and Magrabi tarbushes is a soft
						felt, the same as is in use for felt hats in England ; and as this bead-dress is worn, in one
						form or another, by all officials and sheikhs, and many natives, it seems a pity that some
						attempt is not made to capture this large trade.”</p>
					<p>LORD CROMER’S REFORM.</p>
					<p> QUESTION IN THE HOUSE. </p>
					<p>In the House of Commons yesterday week, Mr. Gooch asked the Secretary for Foreign Affairs
						whether his Majesty’s Government approved Lord Cromer’s proposals for the modification of the
						Capitulations in Egypt ; and if so, when they intended to bring them before the notice of the
						Powers concerned.</p>
					<p>Sir E. Grey: It will be seen, on reference to Lord Cromer’s report, that his remarks
						respecting (the modification of the Capitulations are made in order to elicit an expression of
						local opinion which will be fully and impartially considered before any final and more
						detailed proposals are laid before his Majesty’s Government Any expression of opinion on the
						part of his Majesty’s Government at this stage would, therefore, be premature ; what they
						desire is that the question to which Lord Cromer has called attention should receive attentive
						and impartial con­sideration, with a view to securing eventually reforms which will be both
						effective and acceptable.</p>

					<p>A MUCH-NEEDED REFORM.</p>
					<p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
					<p>Port Said, Thursday.</p>
					<p>As the outcome of a conference of the</p>
					<p>Consols of the town, it has been agreed to put under supervision the registration of
						European public women, as suggested by the sanitary authorities. I trust that this much-needed
						reform will assist in removing the evil repatation our town has often held in the past—a
						reputation which is not warranted by facts, and which is only a repetition of hearsay on the
						part of paswngers and people who have never remained here any length of time. In all towns,
						especially in ports, it is easy to find that which is bad, if people look for it.</p>
					<p>H.M.S. Perseus, second-class cruiser, under command of Capt. H..Christian, and H.M.S. Thetis
						(Capt. Kennedy) are at present at Port Said. The.Minerva arrived early this morning.</p>
					<p>The Hydra, Diana, Knight Errant, Derbyshire, Swanley, Siam, and Knight of the Thistle,with
						15,000 Russian troops, have passed through during the week on their way home.</p>
					<p>On Sunday afternoon M. Dumont, chief of the Transit Service of the Suez Canal, was elected
						president of the Fire. Brigade. M. Lauzanne. engineer of the Canal Company, succeeds M. Simon
						as captain of the Fire Brigade. H.E. the Governor, Mohamed Mouheb Bey, accompanied by Miralai
						Schalch Bey and Bimbashi Bonnelli, thanked Capt. Simon for the excellent services he had
						rendered to the town.</p>
					<p>COAL AND OIL IN EGYPT.</p>
					<p>Mr. J. Wells, in his report on the mining industry in Egypt for the past year, remarks
						:—</p>
					<p>Very considerable interest is attached to the possibility of finding coal or oil in Egyptian
						territory, and I consider it of the utmost importance to Egypt that every encouragement should
						be given to would-be prospec­tors for both of these substances. At present, we have not got
						sufficient information of the geological features of the country to he able to express any
						decided opinion either for or against the occurrence of coal and oil in Egypt. So far as
						investigation has gone, we may assume that the more recent deposits outcropping at the surface
						do not contain commercial bodies or seams of coal, but our knowledge merely appertains to a
						rapid survey of the immediate outcrops of these recent formations, and careful examination and
						deep boring can alone decide the possibility of coal in the formations underlaying those
						immediately on surface. On the Red Sea littoral, in the neighbourhood of Jabel Zeit, petroleum
						undoubtedly exists, but whether in commercial quantities or not is at present undecided. The
						concession lately held by Sir Elwin Palmer and friends over the above area has been abandoned,
						but new people have come forward and expressed a desire to conduct boring operations in the
						neighbourhood, and negotiations are being conducted with a view to granting them the rights
						that they desire. Another party has applied for rights to explore for coal any unleased lands,
						and with a view to giving facilities for those wishing to prospect, a new form of prospecting
						licence has been dratted for all unleased lands throughout Egypt. The general terms of this
						licence are : a yearly fee of L.E. 25 per licence, which will permit the license to take up a
						prospecting area of 25 square miles, and, should coal or oil be found, the right to apply for
						and receive a concession not exceeding 10,000 acres for coal, and 5,000 for oil at a yearly
						rental per acre of P.T. 12 1/3, with a royalty of P.T. 2 1/2 per ton of coal, P.T. 2 1/2 per
						100 gallons of raw oil, and P.T. 15 per ton on mineral waxes or other substances included in
						the licence.</p>

					<p>Notes Et Critiques</p>
					<p>Le Caire, lundi 7 Mai.</p>
					<p>A Londres, le Consolidé anglais est resté, avant-hier, invarié à 89 3/4. L’unifiée a clôturé
						en reprise de 1/8 à 104 1/8. La National Bank a réactionné de 1/8 à 26 3/8. L'agricole est
						restée invariée à 10 1/8, de môme que la Daïra à 17 1/2 et la Delta Light à 12 1/4.</p>
					<p>A Paris, l’action Crédit Foncier Egyptien a regagné 1 franc à 773. La Barque d’Athènes est
						demeurée inchangée à 151.</p>
					<p>Ici, nous avons eu, ce matin, un marché calme et inactif, pour ne pas dire nul. Il y a bien
						eu, de ci de là, quelques transactions, mais elles n’ont guère influé sur la cote, qui se
						maintient, plus ou moins, au niveau de celle de samedi passé. La tendance générale est à
						l’abstention, à l’expectative. On attend les cours d’Occident qui pourraient bien ne fournir
						aucune indication, en arrivant peut-être invariés. Mais encore le sentiment dominantest-il que
						la situation monétaire à Londres ne saurait plus continuer à se tendre, que le taux de
						l’escompte ne tardera pas à subir des réductions et que, par consé quent, une amélioration est
						vraisemblable.</p>
					<p>La National Bank a clôturé à 26 3/8-7/16 ; l’Agricole à 9 15/16 10. Le Comptoir Financier a
						été coté 7 1/8 ex-coupon.</p>
					<p>La Nile Land a été- traitée à 16 1/4 pour s’inscrire en cloture à 16 1/2, malgré une rumpur
						suivant laquelle les négociations relatives à l’achat par la Société du restant do domaine de
						Kasr-el Doubara rencontreraient des obstaçles qui seraient jugés presque insurmontables.</p>
					<p>Il y a eu un certain mouvement sur l’Anglo- American Nile qui, de 5 5/8, a fléchi à 5 5/16
						pour clôturer à 5 7/16. Cette dépression a été déterminée par le bruit que le dividende de
						l’exercice clôturé le 30 Avril 1906 ne serait que de 6 %.</p>

					<p>KEARSLEY AND CUNNINGHAM’S WEEKLY REPORT Liverpool, May 3.</p>
					<p>The demand has again been limited this week for Egyptian on the spot, but prices are firm at
						l/4d. per lb. advance. In futures a fair business has been done, and the latest values are
						:—</p>
					<p>May 9.60J Aug. 9.47 Nov. 8.47</p>
					<p>June 9.67 Sept. 9.39 Deo. 8 36</p>
					<p>July 9.54 Oot. 9.19 Jan. 8.26</p>
					<p>American Futures.—The market this week has been extremely dull, and prices have fluctuated
						within narrow limits. To-day's closing values are 2 @ 3 points higher than those of last
						Thursday. There has been a considerable liquidation of the May and May-June positions,
						transferred into later months, chiefly July-August, and the continued depression in the
						American Stock Market has undoubtedly checked any speculative disposition in Cotton, although
						the undertone if somewhat bullish. As regards the new crop the weather conditions continue
						favourable, but some estimates of the acreage, notably that of Miss Giles, are below general
						expectation but have so far failed to attract much attention, it being considered too early
						for définite results.</p>
					<p>The following are the latest quotations:— May 5.85d Ang./Sept 5.83 Dec./Jan. 5.62 May/Jane
						5.85 Sept./Oct 5.72 Jan./Feb. 5.64 June/July 5.87 Oot./Nov 5.64 Feb./Mar. 5.62 July./Aug 5.87
						Nov./Dec. 5.63.</p>

					<head>EGYPTIAN COTTON SEED EXPORTS</head>
					<p>The rapid increase in the imports of cotton seed to England this year is worth some
						considération by those who are interested in cotton-oil. That there has been also a very large
						expansion in the consumption of oil of late is perfectly obvious, although we have no
						statiastics to guide as in this direction. The first quarter’s exports compare in the bulk as
						follows : —</p>
					<p>1904. 1905. 1906.</p>
					<p>' Torn*. Tons. Tons.</p>
					<p>146,668. 179,460. 237,736.</p>
					<p>The price at Hull at the end of the first quarter was—£18 2s. 6d. in 1904, £14. 2s. 6d. in
						1905, and £18. 5s. in 1906 Notwithstanding the heavy arrivals and the prospect of a larger
						supply of seed than the trade has yet dealt with, values have continued to move upwards, and
						about £2 per ton has been gained since the end of March. The main point affecting the future
						is the chance of greatly increasing Indian applies. We are, the "Manchester Guardian” says,
						getting practically all the Egyptian cotton seed which is available but of available Indian
						seed we are not getting more than about 10 per cent The rapid rise in Indian shipments
						indicates that growers there are waking op to the advantages of utilising their cotton seed,
						and the question is whether they will allow time for the market to absorb the extra quantity
						which they can undoubtedly supply.</p>

					<p>NOTICE,</p>
					<p>Messrs. Haselden and Co., Egyptian Agents for the Royal Insurance Company of Liverpool,
						hereby beg to inform their clients that having regard to the widespread uneasiness which the
						San Francisco disaster has created in the minds of the public generally, the Directors of the
						Royal Insurance Company have made the following official announcement:—</p>
					<p>“ The Royal Insurance Company has</p>
					<p>“ learnt by cablegram from its Manager at</p>
					<p>“ San Francisco that the area of the recent</p>
					<p>“ disaster involves a possible liability of</p>
					<p>“ £1,350,000 (6,750,000dols.). Having regard</p>
					<p>“ however to the large balance at the credit</p>
					<p>“ of Profit and Loss at the end of 1904, and</p>
					<p>“ the profitable results of last year's opera-</p>
					<p>" tions, the payments which will have to be</p>
					<p>“ made in connection wit,h this liability will</p>
					<p>" not necessitate any reduction in the Fire</p>
					<p>“ and Reserve Funds of the Compary.”</p>
					<p>It is anticipated that when the Manager of the Company at San Francisco has been able to
						look closely into the position it will transpire that the Company's losses will be appreciably
						less than the figure mentioned. 27888-4-1</p>

						<head>COUNT BAVASTRO AND COUNT SACKEY.</head>
						<p>The doings of Count Bavastro de Cortazzi, who says he is cf Alexandria, and of his friend
							Count Sackey, who also, we know, was recently here, are arousing great interest in New York,
							The following extracts from New York papers will give some idea of their exploits</p>
						<p>“Cattle Ranch in Egypt” a Myth.</p>
						<p>New York, April 5.—Miss Clare E. Page, a young woman stock trader here, appeared in the
							West Side Police Court yesterday as complainant agaiost Aribert Sackey who was arrested on a
							charge of larceny. Miss Page declared Sackey had posed as a count and that he had obtained
							from her sums aggregating $16,000 to establish a cattle trade with Egypt. The charge,
							however, against the man is that he pawned in St. Louis for $1.0 a Gobelin tapestry valoed at
							$1,500 which Miss Page had given him to sell. Sackey was held in $1,500 bail for a farther
							hearing. (New York '‘Evening News.”)</p>
						<p>Asks Khedive for<hi rend="bold"> $40.</hi>
						</p>
						<p>Magistrate Whitman, in the Tombs Court, paroled Count Bavastro de Cortazzi, arrested for
							failing to pay a board bill of $40. Count Cortazzi was a witness on Wednesday in the inquest
							into the death of Mrs. Blanche Turner Dennis, who died at the Hotel Marseilles. Cordazzi said
							he expeoted a cablegram from the Khedive of Egypt, who would pay his debts. (“New York
							American”).</p>
						<p>Baron’s Left Arm held as Hostage.</p>
						<p>Being now without any arms to speak of Baron London Bavastro de Cortazzi has to pay in
							advance at all the boarding houses and hotels to which he applies.</p>
						<p>His best left arm was taken away from him in West Forty-third street. It is there with his
							trunk. His heart is in Egypt, where he would like to be, and through varions legal
							complications he has nearly lost his head. As matters stand now he declares that his neck has
							felt the heel of the oppressor and that he finds no more joy in living in the United
							States.</p>
						<p>His missing arm was literally talked away from him, for in an argument about a board bill
							alleged to be unpaid he became so distracted that he went away without it. The proprietor of
							the Graystone Hotel, at No. 208 West Forty-third street, still has it, and in addition to
							that he had the Baron arrested for trying to get it again.</p>
						<p>Probably no better left arm can be found in this country than the one which the Baron had.
							It is almost human, although it is made of papier maché, aluminium, steel and wax. Ever since
							he was obliged to part with it the Baron has been in difficulties. The hand of it could twirl
							a cigarette, write checks and carry a cane. One of the most skilled manufacturers of Egypt

							more than it had originally cost. On account of the educated digits on the end, the Baron
							always used this arm for shaking hands, as his right member is not as strong as it might
							be.</p>
						<p>He appeared yesterday afternoon in the Tombs Police Court to answer to the charge made
							against him by an obdurate hotel keeper. He was almost in tears as he spoke of the hardness

							Consul.</p>
						<p>“Never,” said he. “have I heard that a man’s arm was part of his luggage. It is
							indispensable that I have it I find difficulty in going about from place to place and in
							making a creditable appearance.”</p>
						<p>Baron Cortazzi has of late been involved in a series of misfortunes. In addition to his own
							troubles he has had a large share of those of others. He was summoned as a witness before the
							Coroner in the inquest over Mrs. Dennis, Who died in a mysterious manner at the Hotel
							Marseilles.</p>
						<p>But to all these conditions the Baron says if they will give him his good left arm he will
							rise superior. His father has large estates near Alexandria and to him the Baron has cabled
							for a remittance. Meanwhile he has been paroled in the charge of his counsel, Charles B.
							Howe, on his promise to appear next Monday afternoon in the Centre Street Police Court. (“New

						<head>THE SCARCITY OF EGYPTIAN COTTON</head>
						<p>The comparative scarcity of Egyptian and long-stapled American cotton seems, a contemporary
							remarks,to have a natural correspondence with the extraordinary activity among manufacturers
							in the United States who make fine goods. Both for plain and fancy fine makes there is a
							remarkably strong demand, and some mills are said to be sold for fifteen months ahead. The
							ordinary position of things seems to he reversed, and buyers are trying to persuade obdurate
							sellers to extend their engagements. Their reluctance, however, may be accounted for to some
							extent by the suggestion made by a New York authority that some buyers are acoustomed “to
							cancel orders if the trade weakens before deliveries are made.” We have heard very much the
							same kind of thing in connection with our own home trade, and it may be asked whether the
							present time, when sellers are in an unusually strong position, does not give an opportunity
							to bring about some reformation in ways of doing business. More stringent contracts in the
							home trade would do something to amend it, and it is certainly remarkable that some of those
							manufacturers who have lately neglected their home in favour of their shipping trade have
							expressed relief in the comparative freedom from slipslop ways.</p>

					<head>EGYPTAIN LABOUR MARKET.</head>
					<head>EUROPEANS v. NATIVES.</head>
					<p>( From Lord Cromer’s Report. )</p>
					<p>So active and progressive is the building trade that contractors find it impossible to
						secure an adequate supply of masons plasterers, carpenters, etc. It cannot be doubted that,
						before long, much will he done in the direction of improved sanitation, involving the
						employment of a large number of plumbers ; at present almost all the plumbing is done by
						Europeans. Electricity is coming into more extensive use ; at present all the electric fitters
						are Europeans. Educational advance foreshadows more work for the printer and the bookbinder.
						It is also to be observed that the European population is rapidly increasing. Provision has to
						he made for its special wants. Moreover, native Egyptians, in their dress and customs, are to
						a great extent adopting European fashions, with the result that European demands are steadily
						increasing. At present, almost all these wants are supplied by Europeans. It is difficult to
						find a native cobbler who can sole and heel a pair of boots fairly well, although boots have
						now become almost an article of native wear. Boot-mending, as well as boot-making, are almost
						entirely in the hands of Greeks and Armenians. The European provision trade is practically
						monopolized by Greeks ; the drapery trade by Jews, Syrians, and Europeans ; the tailoring
						trade by Jews.</p>
					<p>So far, the Egyptians have shown but little capacity to seize the new opportunities for
						profitable enterprise offered by these new developments This is more especially to be
						regretted, owing to the fact that the industries, in which the natives themselves have for
						centuries found employment, appear to a great extent to be in process of extinction. I alluded
						to this subject in my last Annual Report (p. 74) I may here add that the tramway is
						supplanting the Egyptian donkey, and that with the latter is disappearing its saddle-maker and
						the maker of its trappings. With the disuse of stone floors, the trade of the straw mat maker
						is tending to become obsolete. Modern pumping apparatus is displacing the rough-hewn
						waterwheel. The native tanner, lacking technical knowledge and guidance, is being ousted by
						his more skilled European competitor. The textile industries—with the exception of silk, in
						which there has recently been some revival—are in a declining state. The products of native
						looms are being supplanted by the steam-woven fabrics of Europe, and with them the ancillary
						art of dyeing is decaying. I am informed that even indigo dyeing has practically ceased; the
						calico, out of which the dress of the fellah is made, being now imported ready dyed by
						artificial indigo. The flowing robes of delicate shades and embroidered vests, fashioned by
						the native tailor, are abandoned for the ready-made clothing of continental slop-shops. The
						manufacture of red slippers has sunk to insignificant proportions. Frequently the red slippers
						of the Sheikhs —the 'most conservative of all classes — are not slippers at all, but
						European-made boots, of which the lower portion is an imitation of the native pointed red
						slipper, and the uppers are cunningly formed of coloured web to imitate socks. The
						upholsterer, who could cover a divan to meet the needs of the last generation, finds himself
						unequal to the new demand for Louis XV brocaded chairs and couches. In furniture, clothing,
						and all necessities, the upper classes are now supplied almost entirely with European goods,
						and the tendency is working downwards.</p>

					<head>FAYOUM S.P.C.A</head>
					<p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
					<p>Fayoum, Tuesday.</p>
					<p>A general meeting of the Feyoum branch of the S.P.C.A. was held at the Moudirieh under the
						presidency of H. E. the Moudir. A large number of members were present, including Major
						Elgood.</p>
					<p>The Moudir read the report on the past year’s work of the society, pointing out that in the
						six months of 1905 during which the society had been in operation the results achieved
						compared very favourably with a whole year’s work of other provincial branches, despite the
						fact that it was handicapped by want of funds. A supplementary report also showed that from
						January 10 to April 24 the society had dealt with 109 donkeys, 9 mules, 6 horses, and 1 camel,
						or a total from January 10, 1905 to April 24, 1906, of 301 donkeys, 25 mules, 51 horses, and 6
						camels.</p>
					<p>After the meeting had approved of the report various suggestions were made for improving the
						financial condition of the society, and for extending the scope of its operations to the
						different districts. It was finally agreed that a committee should be formed in every markaz,
						with the mamour as president.</p>
					<p>The general committee consists of Ibrahim Bey Neghib, Ahmed Bey Hassan, Aly Bey Ahdullal, M.

					<p>It was decided to proceed as soon as possible with the construction of the new stables.</p>
					<p>The Moudir proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Way. the hon. secretary, for his unremitting

					<head>LORD CROMER'S REFORM PROPOSALS.</head>
					<div type="article">
						<head>FRENCH VIEW</head>
						<p>Discussing the reforms in Egyptian jurisdiction proposed by Lord Cromer, the “Temps” makes
							the following statement of the French view of the subject:</p>
						<p>“While Consular jurisdiction, although very restricted in Egypt, may lead to certain abuses
							there the mixed tribunals do not deserve the criticisms Lord Cromer applies to them. We
							consider it our duty, however, to point out from the outset that the scheme he puts forward
							has not only the disadvantage of putting in question the most express rights of the Powers
							and of impairing the moral and material position they occupy in Egypt, it also involves the
							risk of substituting the unknown for a régime which has stood the test and h is had an
							opportunity of showing its virtues in practice. We do not think, of course, of contesting the
							political preponderance which pertains to Great Britain in the Khediviate ; but it is hard to
							see how the existence of the mixed tribunals; precious to the foreign colonies, can he a
							cause of danger and inconvenience to Great Britain.”</p>
						<p>The “Journal des Débats” in commenting on the Earl of Cromer’s report upon the repeal of
							the international régime in Egypt asks, “Have we to resist a reform of this nature, to refuse
							it our assent, which is as necessary as that of any of the thirteen Powers signatory to the
							Convention of 1876?” Answering the question, it says : “Nothing in the internal situation
							calls upon ns to do so,” and adds : “At the moment when the British are pushing the
							advantages which accrue to them from the agreement of 1904 they ought to desire to give us
							the satisfaction of settling the questions which may still arise. There are, perhaps, some
							latent questions regarding Liberia. There are some open questions relating to the New
							Hebrides and Ethiopia, where a very clear agreement between the Governments of Paris and
							London would be the best check upon the financial intrigues which have multiplied around the
							internationalisation of the railway from Djibouti to Addis Abeba. There we have a situation
							which at the time when Lord Cromer’s project calls for new negotiations on the basis of the
							understanding of 1904 ought not to escape M. Léon Bourgeois.”</p>

					<head>STRANDING OF THE EGYPTIAN PRINCE</head>
					<p>The following is the finding of the court of enquiry held at Malta into the recent stranding
						of the S.S Egyptian Prince :—</p>
					<p>The British steamship Egyptian Prince O. N. 114,422 of 2010 register tonnage, and with a
						crew of 33 men all told besides eight passengers, was approaching Malta on the 21st April
						1906, coming from Alexandria. The ship had to call at Malta for coal. At about 7.30 p.m.,
						Marsascirocco Lighthouse bearing No. 75’ W (true) when the steamer was on a N. 64° W. coarse
						The sky was clouded and it was hazy over the land. At about 8.10 p.m. a fixed bright light was
						observed on land which those on board took for the St. Elmo light. The master of the Egyptian
						Prince, Armstrong Dawns, was on the bridge and from that time onward he caused his vessel to
						swing outside so as ultimately to steer North. The ship then stranded at 8.30 p.m. on the
						Munxiar Rocks, a reef the master had calculated to be passing clear off at least a mile. It
						was subsequently ascertained that the bright light mistaken by the master of the ship for that
						of St. Elmo lighthouse was the cupola of the Military Gymnasium in Cottonera illuminated by
						electricity. That Cupola bore to the reef on which the ship had stranded N. W. by W. by
						compass, equivalent to N. 62 W. true. St. Elmo’s light would have the same cross-bearing with
						Delimara lighthouse only that the same cross-bearings of the lighted cupola would bring the
						ship’s navigation one mile to the S. W. from the safe course.</p>
					<p>The Nautical Assessors think that Captain Downs’ mistake is an error to which Master
						Mariners are liable without any sense of neglect being attached to their seamanship. The
						bright light was made out in the midst of the loom of the lights of a modern town on a bearing
						that represented a safe course of approach and therefore under conditions that would have
						induced any careful navigator to shape his course accordingly without any anxiety as to the
						safety of his vessel.</p>
					<p>The Court therefore comes to the conclusion that the stranding of the Egyptian Prince on the
						21st April 1906 was not due to any neglect or want of careful navigation on the part of
						Captain Armstrong Downs, who at the time was in charge of the ship.</p>
					<p>He is therefore acquitted.</p>

						<head>THE NATIVE ATTITUDE</head>
						<p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette; </p>
						<p>Sir,—One of the most interesting aspects of the present crisis, engendered by the dispute
							between the Sultan and Great Britain over the frontier question, is the attitude of the
							Moslem population and of their Press, who are in favour of the resumption of Turkish
							authority over Egypt. This state of feeling is not concealed, and is indeed one of the most
							serious symptoms in the present crisis. It is therefore very significant of the prejudices
							prevailing among some ignorant Europeans that a correspondent of the “Egyptian Gezette”
							should have ventured to declare in yesterday’s issue that it would be strange if the
							Egyptians were not either neutral or friendly to the British Occupation “for it is
							inconceivable that after enjoying many years of freedom from tyranny and experiencing
							ever-growing prosperity they would wish to go back to the old misrule—or worse.” This point
							of view could only be maintained by a person who is totally ignorant of the Moslem and his
							views, and who has the most superficial acquaintance with the Oriental in general. The idea
							that the Egyptian should be grateful to the English because they have freed him from tyranny
							is childishly absurd, for tyranny is the only form of government that an Oriental can
							understand. Thousands of Moslems in Bosnia and The saly have left those countries since they
							came under Christian domination in order to live under the rule of the Sultan, because the
							autocratic and theocratic rule of the Caliph in their eyes far outweighed all the discomforts
							and expense of leaving the country, wherein they had lived for generations, when it was
							handed over to European rule. I confess I sympathise with them. I only live in Egypt "because
							I am forced to do so, but I would far rather go back to England it I could, and face the
							awful weather, the exactions of the Income Tax, the enormous rates and all the other burthens
							of London life although I know that under the Khedivial Government I am far better off than I
							would be in England. Blood is thicker than water, and Islam as a religion has ties far closer
							than even those of race and family to the European. It is absurd to think therefore that the
							Egyptian should cast aside such associations out of gratitude to us for having bestowed on
							him the blessings of an alien civilisation which he does not want and should rally to the
							side of England against the Caliph. Why should the Egyptian be grateful to us for having
							foisted on him the cheap European stook-in-trade, which is comprehensively labelled
							“Progress” ? I have lived in Egy pt for many years and, the more I see of the native, the
							more convinced I am that in his heart of hearts he is becoming more and more bored with the
							so-called blessings of civilisation, which we deal out to him with such a liberal hand, and
							would by no means object to seeing a change.</p>
						<p>Of course this point of view is quite incomprehensible to the majority of Englishmen in
							Egypt or at home, but, it is clear enough to everyone one who is not a prey to Podsnappery,
							which is endemic among so many of my countrymen in Egypt. Personally, of course, I am sorry
							that the native cannot he brought to appreciate Progress (with a capital P) and is so
							perverse as to prefer the rule of the Caliph, bat at the same time I am not at all sure that,
							if I were a native, I would not feel rather weary of the great pace with which Egypt is being
							hurried along the path of Progress and sigh for a change to the “good old times.” Such is the
							attitude of many Egyptians, and really when we come to think of it there is as much to be
							said on behalf of their point of view as of ours.—I am, etc.,</p>

						<head>BATHING AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
						<p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
						<p>Sir,—Alexandrians do not know how to ap­preciate the good gifts which a bounteous nature
							has so liberally bestowed upon them.</p>
						<p>Especially is this observation true respecting their sea-bathing. Off the shores of their
							noble city is a magnificent expanse of sea, and to encourage them to make fall use of it a
							kindly Providence—their Titular Deity—sends them persuasive khamseens to urge them into its
							waves. It is not that they have any objection to accepting the hint—rather they avail
							themselves of the opportunity whenever it arises. Bat between rudely plunging into the sea
							and bathing in the right sense of the term there is a great gulf fixed ; and I am sorry to
							say that Alexandrians stand on the wrong side of that gulf. The fact is that they do not know
							how to bathe. Like with everything else, sea-bathing is a fine art, and as such it is
							considered in Turkey, a country which one is accustomed to regard as lacking in the
							refinements of advanced civilization. In this respect, however, Turkey can give the
							Alexandrians points. First of all, instead of a row of ungainly cabins, the barbarian Turk
							erects upon the sea a quadrangular building of lath upon piles which can be easily removed on
							the first approach of winter. A sheltered bay or creek, with a good sandy bottom, is selected
							for the site, but out of strict observance of the laws of the Koran, mixed bathing is
							forbidden, and in obedience to this precept the bathhouses for either sex along the shores of
							the Bosphorus and Marmora are separated by the intervals which decency and religion appoint.
							Moreover, the women must not swim out, or expose themselves, and so rigid is the regulation
							thereto respecting that an ample circumvallation of wooden hoarding completely conceals from
							the <cb n="5"/>inquisitive view the interior of the building and the faintest vestige of the
							charms of its inmates. Every physical comfort is studied and attended to. Thus the square of
							sea enclosed by the bath house is sufficiently shaded from the sun by a wooden roof, without,
							however, entirely shutting out the rays. The cabins are built, like in any ordinary swimming
							bath, opening on to the platform ; but with this difference, that the doors cover only half
							the cabin and so the bather while drying or dressing can watch the sport of the others in the
							water. As in ancient Rome, the Turkish bath-house to-day, whether on land or sea, is the
							meeting place of all ; in fact, on the Bosphorus bathing is a social function ; there is none
							of that stiffness and cold shoulder so noticeable in Anglo-Saxon natatory circles. Common
							immersion induces among the Turks and their fellow-citizens a feeling of kinship one for the
							other—high or low—which is lacking elsewhere ; humanity under such circumstances is placed on
							an equal footing by a return to Adamaic simplicity.</p>
						<p>Coffee and simids are served as soon as the bather has dried himself, and clad in the
							gaudy-colored bournous, and basking in the beautiful sunlight, he can either indulge in the
							luxury of a sunbath, or enjoy the pleasure of genial conversation and the gentle exercise of
							a peripatetic in company with his fellows, pleasures which recall the Academic Groves. In
							this wise, philosophically, sheltered from the sun, fanned by the sea-breezes, the hours
							glide down the golden flood of time; thus only is true enjoyment found, unalloyed with the
							disturbing elements of a false civilization. Compared with these joys what have the
							Alexandrians ? A few dog kennels jumbled along the shore ; no coffee, no simids, no shade,
							and worse of all, a mixed bathing which enforces the conventions of the drawing room and the
							etiquette of fashion into the depths of the sea. —I am, etc.,</p>

					<head>MOUNT TROODOS,</head>
					<p>Cyprus,</p>
					<p>A limited, number of paying guests can be received by a Lady during the Summer Months.
						Cyprus is 24 hours by sea from Port Said. Troodos 6,406 feet above the sea is a delightful and
						healthy place amongst the pine forests where the troops and Government Officials spend the hot
						season.</p>
					<p>Terms 2 1/2 Guineas per week.</p>
					<p>For further particulars apply to Miss YOUNG,</p>
					<p>Nikosia, or to the Editor.</p>
					<p>Further Particulars.</p>
					<p>Position. The pine covered slope« of Mount Troodos where Miss Young has a camp, are about
						64' 6 feet above the sea ; the troops stationed in Cyprus and the Principal Government
						Officials live there during the hot season from about June till October.</p>
					<p>Routes. Troodos is about 35 miles from the port of Limassol from which there is a good
						carriage road to Platres 31 m. Beyond Platres the road is good but steep and from that point
						people often ride on mules for the rest of the journey. There is also an excellent road from
						the Capital, Nicosia, by which persons going from that side of the Island drive all the way
						(about 16 miles).</p>
					<p>Climate. The climate is very dry and healthy, in the daytime it is delightful ; the nights,
						especially after the end of August, are often rather cold.</p>
					<p>Dress. There is a good deal of red dust on the hills and ladies should be provided with
						washing skirts. White is a good deal worn, but it is advisable to have some brown, fawn or
						dost coloured linen dresses which do not shew dust stains as the washing is not first rate. A
						warm woollen "coat and skirt” costume is also indispensable.</p>
					<p>Rides. There are plenty of delightful rides amongst the hills, but the roads and bridle
						paths are too steep for bicycles. Mules and ponies can be hired for the season.</p>
					<p>Expeditions. Places of interest to be reached on mule or pony back are Kykko Monastery
						Kalopanayioti, Trooditissa Monastery, etc.</p>
					<p>Games. There is a Tennis Club with two good courts, there are also one or two private tennis
						and croquet grounds.</p>
					<p>Church. An English Church Service is held twice on Sundays at the Regimental Recreation
						Room.</p>
					<p>Water. The water supply is good and the drinking water pure and wholesome</p>
					<p>Money. Drafts on the Imperial Ottoman Bank and English gold and notes accepted.</p>
					<p>By June the railway which runs from Famagusta to Nikosia will be extended to within 30 miles
						of Nikosia.</p>
